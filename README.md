Another hacky extension for the [ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/), this time for Tmux.

It searches your open sessions and attaches to them.

If no sessions found, you can create new one.

This extension uses gnome-terminal by default. If your terminal emulator is different, you should check and edit the parameters in settings.
